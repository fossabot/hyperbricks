**Note:**  

This project and it's documentation is currently incomplete and in the experimental phase. It is recommended to use the code only for exploration or from a developer's perspective at this stage. If you're interested, you can explore the components and composite renderers in the `internal/component` and `internal/composite` directories.

The `<API>` type is currently undocumented because it is still evolving and likely to change. Note that `<API>` and `<API_RENDER>` are distinct types.". 

- **`<API_RENDER>`**: Renders a template using data fetched from an external endpoint.  
- **`<API>`**: Integrates with a `<MODEL>`, connects to a database, and simplifies common use cases (such as CRUD operations) with minimal configuration.
