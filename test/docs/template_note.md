## HyperBricks Documentation

HyperBricks is a headless content management system that aims to bridge front and back-end development of [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) powered hypermedia applications.  

This is done by creating configuration files (referred to as "hyperbricks") that allows you to declare and describe the state of a document in a concise and structured manner.

### Key Features:
#### Declarative Configurations:
Write your web page structure, hierarchy and behavior in easy-to-read configuration files.
#### Dynamic Rendering: 
Use HTMX to dynamically update parts of your page without a full reload.
#### Modular and Reusable:
Configure components once and reuse them across pages through object inheritance and reusability.
