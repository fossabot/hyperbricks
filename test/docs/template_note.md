## HyperBricks Documentation

HyperBricks aims to bridge front and back-end development of [htmx](https://htmx.org/) powered hypermedia applications using nested declarative configuration files. These configuration files (referred to as "hyperbricks") allows to declare and describe the state of a document in a concise and structured manner.

* The project is still in alpha stage, but the features documented here are tested and will work.
